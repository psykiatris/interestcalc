# interestcalc
An IntelliJ project with simple classes to calculate interest on savings and credit card accounts.

Currently this project has four parts. Calculate interest based on entering daily balances for a given cycle for savings and credit cards. One to amortize a mortgage showing payments and interest, one to grow a savings account, adding any investment deposits and interest, showing interest earned over a multi-year period. 
Now working on consolidating all the functions into a concise set of classes for readability.
